      <h2>About Bad Piggies</h2>
      <p>After nearly 10 years of development, Rovio's Angry Birds series has become a giant game brand with billions of downloads on many different operating systems. The battle between Angry Birds and Piggies is the inspiration for them to create many games like Angry Birds Go! or Angry Birds Match. However, perhaps we were too unfair with the Piggies.</p>

      <h3>Pick your Favorite Car</h3>
      <p>If Angry Birds mainly refers to attack and destruction, then Bad Piggies is more peaceful and constructive. Your task in this game is to build a car to help the blue pig move from its original position to its destination safely. The game play is quite similar to Love Balls, but instead of drawing the path with a pen, you have to assemble a rudimentary car with the available equipment.

      Once completed, your car will automatically move. Your job is to assemble the necessary equipment such as wheels, frames, boosters, and find how to bring the green pig to the finish line. On the way, you can use the devices you paired to create thrust to help the car move as you like. If Piggies falls before reaching the destination, your game will end. But be aware that, even if your car is destroyed, somehow you still bring the blue pig to the destination, you still count as the winner.
        
      Of course, Piggies job is still stealing the eggs of Angry Birds. On the way, you need to collect a sufficient number of eggs if you want to reach the maximum score (3 stars) of the game.</p>

      <h3>Hundreds of Levels</h3>
      <p>When playing Bad Piggies, you need to conquer 200 puzzles corresponding to 200 levels of the game. After completing some levels with 3 stars, you will have the opportunity to unlock 40 special levels of the game. The game has two modes including Ground Hog Day and When Pigs Fly. If you get stuck too long at Ground Hog Day, you can practice in When Pigs Fly mode to relax.

      Although the game encourages creativity, still there is something bound by each level that limits the number of equipment you can use. You need to do exactly what the game requires if you want to get the maximum score.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>If you get stuck, you can use Bad Piggies help, the game will show you how to assemble a standard car to get the maximum score of that level. Of course, you have to pay to buy. But Rovio offers 3 free supports (you need to like Bad Piggies on Facebook to get them) to help players understand how to use this help. Remember to use it only in really deadlock situations!</p>
