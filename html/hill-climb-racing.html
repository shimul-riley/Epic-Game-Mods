      <h2>About Hill Climb Racing</h2>
      <p>The game introduces gamers to the world of hill racing where you'll have the opportunities to explore all the amazing aspects of the game. Join Newton Bill, the young and daring uphill racer who've always dreamed of being the world most successful hill racer. And to do that, he's going to need your help to get to his goal.

      <h3>Pick your Favorite Car</h3>
      <p>The game also features dozens of different challenges that you could take on during your journey. Climb on different surfaces as you try your best on varied vehicles. Perform daring tricks to earn yourself additional bonuses and points. Upgrade your cars to give them even more powers and abilities. But don't push it too far without proper considerations as you'll need to protect your beloved Bill from serious injuries. And his fragile neck won't be able to handle all the fuzz.</p>

      <h3>Life Lesson</h3>
      <p>The best thing about Hill Climb Racing is that it teaches us to embrace our failures and learn to thrive from those.

Those are only some of the many reasons that makes hill climb racing is a great game.</p>
