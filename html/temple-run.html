      <h2>About Temple Run</h2>
      <p>The born of the game Subway Surfers is the clearest evidence showing how attractive the endless-runner game genre is. It was soon installed by millions of players around the world when it was first released. And by the time you read this article, the number has risen to over one billion. However, the idea of SYBO Games was soon duplicated. Temple Run is what I'm talking about. But with some new things in game play and new features, it will give you an unforgettable experience.</p>

      <h3>Run through a lot of Challenges</h3>
      <p>As you know, the challenges of Subway Surfers mostly come from obstacles. They can and are stationary objects like roadblocks, or moving objects like a train moving in the opposite direction. Temple Run is more than that. Roads are quite heavy destroyed, very small to travel and sometimes without screens on either side. This road also creates deep holes, which can take your character's life. So grab your seat belt tight and get ready for a thrilling run for your player's life.</p>

      <h3>Behind the Story</h3>
      <p>Temple Run has a story behind. It tells the story of a group of explorers entering an ancient forest and stealing a statue of a god in a cursed temple. When they stepped outside, they realized a giant monkey was chasing them to reclaim something they shouldn't have.

      After all, there was only one survivor in the team of adventurers. He is holding the statue and trying to escape when death is chasing behind.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In the process of moving along the temple to escape the evil monkeys, the game system will provide support items such as coins and magic charms so you can go through obstacles.

      However, it is a fairly passive way and you should not expect it too much. Instead, upgrade the power (Powerups) and the usefulness (Utilities) to play better. It gives the character the ability to run speedily in a fairly long distance (depending on the level upgraded), invisible for a period of time to escape any danger or boost forward 2500m from the start to have more scores. So being all that said, we wish you and your player good luck. Enjoy!</p>
