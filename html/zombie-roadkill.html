      <h2>About Zombie Roadkill</h2>
      <p>Are you ready for the most intense speed fight between gunner and zombie? The topic isn't weird, but it's the first time I'm seeing this kind of fast action combo. You love the topic of zombies but have been “overloaded” by action role-playing games or slow brain-damaging tower defense? Are you looking for something new, more intense, more diverse, and more aggressive, and have a speed element? Thank God, Zombie Roadkill 3D has come and will help you satisfy all of the above requirements.</p>

      <h3>Weapons And Vehicle</h3>
      <p>With the first-person shooter role-playing part, you will have 10 different weapons. Of course, in the first scenes, you need to focus on shooting down as many zombies as possible to collect points. Having points will gradually accumulate weapons, upgrade from classic guns to large-barreled guns, rocket guns capable of destroying a large number of zombies at once. Watching the power gradually increasing with this powerful arsenal will give you great excitement and the fire of battle. In the scenes of driving over zombies, the spotlight is on the vehicles that you will be upgrading through each level. There are currently 5 types of vehicles, and all of them are majestic, well-armed, just looking at them makes me want to play. Each type of vehicle will have different shapes, movements, and weapons.</p>

      <h3>Your Goal in The Game</h3>
      <p>In this game, you have two choices. One is to kill them all to live, the other is to be eaten by them without time to yawn. Simple as that. So, all you need to do is to fight fiercely at lightning speed from the very first scenes.</p>

      <h3>Driving</h3>
      <p>On the other hand, it is also necessary to avoid hitting other vehicles or obstacles on the road. Because every time you collide, your car will stop a bit to return to the old equilibrium before rolling again. In zombie games, when there is only 1 second late, you know what can happen. These high-class zombies have a small blood column on their heads to indicate the number of them lying on the car and also indicate whether you have knocked them out or not. If you let them live for too long, they can break into the car and drag you out to kill you instantly. Or if there are too many zombies on the car, the car may tip over and fall before you can reach the finish line. So, grab your seat belt tight and Enjoy!</p>
